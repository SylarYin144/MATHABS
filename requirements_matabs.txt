# Python Version Recommendation:
# For the broadest compatibility with all listed dependencies, Python 3.10 or 3.11 is recommended.
# Some older libraries in this list may have more stable pre-compiled versions for these Python releases.
# Note: 'statsmodels' has been updated to a version compatible with Python 3.12.
# If using Python 3.12 and encountering build issues with other packages, consider using Python 3.10/3.11 or installing C++ Build Tools.

# statsmodels>=0.14.0 is required for Python 3.11+ (including 3.12) due to 'inspect.formatargspec' removal.
# Version 0.14.1 is compatible with numpy<2.0 (requires numpy>=1.21).
